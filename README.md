These are Labs modules for MongoDB.

In mongo repository directory:
   mkdir src/mongo/db/modules/
   ln -sf ~/labs-modules src/mongo/db/modules/
   
Labs modules works in the same way as Enterprise modules. Please refer to the Wiki [here](https://wiki.corp.mongodb.com/display/HGTC/The+MongoDB+Enterprise+Module%3A+An+FAQ) for more information on module discovery.

After linking the labs-modules folder, please go ahead and build the server as you normally would.
